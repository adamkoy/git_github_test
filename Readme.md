How to track files with Git


1) - $ git add .
-After you have made your files in (master)
- you type git add . (adds the files)
- I want you to track this file for me
2) Click ' git status'

when it is green - means that git is watching it
If it is RED it is not being tracked

Then do git add .. adds everything. and do git status.
Git knows youve been working on it but havent created a version of it.
if it fails or errors, can find it. So we need to commit to create a version
Create a version

3) git commit -m 'meaningful message'
 - Type when you need to make a certain version i.e every 1 hour
 - 5 folders at the same time - git will track everything
 - needs to check git status - can't see new files
  - only shows when there is a file inside it
  - making another snap shot - with a message
  - snapshot has your number.. Keep going back and forth


  4) git push -u  remote origin master
  - fatal means it did not work
  git remote was in example and not in the specific file
